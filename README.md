# Possible upgrade

Implementation of Jamstack is one of the choices I may consider to do in the future. 
Acoording to jamstack.org, "The core principles of pre-rendering, and decoupling, enable sites and applications to be delivered with greater confidence and resilience than ever before.". I may breakdown service from what mentioned "Traditional Web" into "Jamstack". 
![Jamstack architecture](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b7d16f7f3654fb8572360301e60d76df254a323e/385ec/img/svg/architecture.svg)

The required procedure would be
1. migration web server to CDN
2. convertion of monolithic to microservices
